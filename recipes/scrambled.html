      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This is a recipe for scrambled eggs. It's the best way to cook an egg.
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>butter or oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>msg (NOT OPTIONAL)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by heating up the pan. We should move fast like we're already
          late for work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Crack the eggs into a bowl (hit them on a flat surface to avoid shells
          in the eggs).
        </li>
        <li>Put salt, pepper and msg to taste.</li>
        <li>
          Put some butter on the pan, at least enough to cover the surface, more
          if you're an obese fuck.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat the eggs with a fork or whisk them if you're a rich asshole.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the pan.</li>
        <li>
          Start stirring, how fast depends on how big you want the curds to be.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it looks like it's almost but not yet cooked, take it off the heat.
          It's done.
        </li>
      </ol>
